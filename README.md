# FixMe
In this repository, I removed some basic errors from the code. There were these mistakes:
1. The closing bracket of the main function was missing.
2. The logic for removing the numbers less than zero was wrong. We call this a semantic error.
3. The declaration of ArrayList was missing the last pair of brackets.
   and more.
